We're pleased to announce that version 0.2.0 of the R package **storywranglr** is now available on CRAN.

This package makes it easy to use the [Storywrangler API](https://github.com/janeadams/storywrangler) to explore large-scale patterns in social media usage captured in Storywrangler, a data set of over 1 billion tweets from 2008 to 2021 ([Alshaabi et al., 2021](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabe6534.full)). This data is very helpful for tracing macro-trends in consumer interests and behaviour, and opens up a range of research avenues in marketing and the social sciences.

We're working on a white paper, but in the meantime you can [get the package from CRAN here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/storywranglr/), [see the code on GitHub](https://github.com/chris31415926535/storywranglr), and [read an open-access paper from Storywrangler's authors on Science Advances](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabe6534).
